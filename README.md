# All Mathematics

This repository aims to be a comprehensive, interconnected knowledge base of mathematical and scientific concepts, from the foundational to the applied.

## Structure

The content is organized hierarchically into major fields. Each concept has its own file, detailing its definition, applications, variants, and relationships to other concepts.

## Main Areas

- [**Foundations of Mathematics**](./foundations_of_mathematics/README.md)
  - The bedrock of mathematical thought, including logic, set theory, and category theory.

- [**Pure Mathematics**](./pure_mathematics/README.md)
  - The study of mathematical concepts independently of any application outside mathematics.

- [**Applied Mathematics**](./applied_mathematics/README.md)
  - The application of mathematical methods to different fields such as science, engineering, business, and industry.

- [**Physics**](./physics/README.md)
  - The natural science that studies matter, its fundamental constituents, its motion and behavior through space and time, and the related entities of energy and force.

- [**Computer Science**](./computer_science/README.md)
  - The study of computation, information, and automation, with deep roots in mathematical logic. Includes topics like Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

## Ways to Explore

This knowledge base can be navigated in several ways:

- **By Field**: Start from one of the main areas above and dive into specific subfields. See the comprehensive [List of Concepts by Field](./_lists/by_field.md).
- **By Generality**: (Coming soon) A list of concepts organized from the most abstract and general to the most concrete.
- **By Application**: (Coming soon) A list of concepts organized by their field of application.
- **Graphical View**: (Coming soon) A graph visualizing the connections between concepts.
