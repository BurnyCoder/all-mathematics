# Regression Analysis

- **Mathematical Definition**: Regression analysis is a set of statistical processes for estimating the relationships between a dependent variable (often called the 'outcome' or 'response' variable) and one or more independent variables (often called 'predictors', 'covariates', or 'features'). The most common form is **linear regression**, where a model assumes a linear relationship between the independent variables \\(X\\) and the dependent variable \\(y\\):
  \\( y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \cdots + \beta_p X_p + \epsilon \\)
  where \\(\beta_0, \dots, \beta_p\\) are the **regression coefficients** to be estimated, and \\(\epsilon\\) is the error term. The coefficients are typically estimated by minimizing the **sum of squared residuals** (the difference between the observed and predicted values), a method known as **ordinary least squares (OLS)**.

- **Description**: Regression analysis is a powerful statistical method that allows for examining the relationship between two or more variables of interest. It is a core tool for prediction and forecasting. The goal is to build a model that can predict the value of a dependent variable based on the values of the independent variables.

- **Subfields and concepts it includes**:
    - **Linear Regression**: The most basic form of regression.
    - **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)**: The standard method for estimating the coefficients of a linear regression model.
    - **Residuals**: The differences between the observed values and the values predicted by the model.
    - **Goodness of Fit (R-squared)**: A statistic that measures how well the model explains the variability of the dependent variable.
    - **Hypothesis Testing**: Used to determine if the relationship between the variables is statistically significant.

- **Applications**:
    - **Economics and Finance**: Forecasting GDP, inflation, stock prices, and assessing the impact of policy changes.
    - **Medicine**: Identifying risk factors for diseases.
    - **Marketing**: Predicting sales based on advertising spending.
    - **Machine Learning**: Used as a basic predictive modeling technique.

- **More Concrete Variants**:
    - **Simple Linear Regression**: A linear regression model with only one independent variable.
    - **Multiple Linear Regression**: A model with multiple independent variables.
    - **Polynomial Regression**: A model where the relationship between the variables is modeled as an nth-degree polynomial.

- **More General Variants**:
    - **Generalized Linear Models (GLMs)**: A flexible generalization of ordinary linear regression that allows for response variables that have error distribution models other than a normal distribution.
    - **Logistic Regression**: A type of regression used when the dependent variable is categorical (e.g., win/lose, pass/fail).
    - **Non-linear Regression**: A form of regression analysis in which observational data are modeled by a function which is a nonlinear combination of the model parameters.
    - **Ridge and Lasso Regression**: Regularized regression methods used to prevent overfitting.

- **Related Concepts**:
    - **[Random Variable](../probability_theory/random_variable.md)**: The variables in a regression model are random variables.
    - **[Gradient Descent](../../computer_science/machine_learning/gradient_descent.md)**: An alternative method for finding the regression coefficients, especially in the context of large-scale machine learning.
    - **Correlation**: A measure of the linear relationship between two variables. Regression describes the nature of that relationship.
