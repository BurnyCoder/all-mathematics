# Modal Logic

- **Mathematical Definition**: Modal logic is a type of formal logic that extends classical propositional and predicate logic to include operators expressing modality. A modal operator is an operator that expresses a "mode" in which a proposition can be true. For example, modal logic can be used to reason about necessity and possibility. The standard modal operators are $\Box$ for necessity and $\Diamond$ for possibility.

- **Description**: Modal logic is a formal system that allows for the expression of statements about what is necessary, possible, contingent, or impossible. It is used to analyze and formalize arguments and reasoning involving these concepts. The semantics of modal logic are often given in terms of "possible worlds," an idea developed by Saul Kripke.

- **Subfields it's part of**:
    - [Mathematical Logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_logic): It is a significant branch of non-classical logic.
    - [Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy): It has deep roots in philosophical logic, particularly in metaphysics and epistemology.
    - [Computer Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science): It is widely used in theoretical computer science.

- **Subfields and concepts it includes**:
    - **Alethic Logic**: The logic of necessity and possibility.
    - **Epistemic Logic**: The logic of knowledge and belief.
    - **Deontic Logic**: The logic of obligation and permission.
    - **Temporal Logic**: The logic of time and temporal relations.
    - **Doxastic Logic**: The logic of belief.

- **Applications**:
    - **Artificial Intelligence**: Used to model the knowledge and beliefs of intelligent agents.
    - **Formal Verification**: Used to verify the correctness of computer programs and hardware designs, particularly in the context of temporal logic.
    - **Linguistics**: Used to analyze the semantics of natural language, especially expressions of modality.
    - **Game Theory**: Used to model the reasoning of players in a game.

- **More Concrete Variants**:
    - **System K**: The weakest normal modal logic, serving as a base for most other modal systems.
    - **System T**: Adds the axiom $\Box p \to p$ (what is necessary is true).
    - **System S4**: Adds the axiom $\Box p \to \Box\Box p$ (if something is necessary, it is necessarily necessary).
    - **System S5**: Adds the axiom $\Diamond p \to \Box\Diamond p$. It is often used for reasoning about knowledge.

- **More General Variants**:
    - **First-Order Modal Logic**: Combines modal logic with first-order (predicate) logic, allowing for quantification over objects in possible worlds.
    - **Provability Logic**: A type of modal logic where the necessity operator is interpreted as "it is provable in Peano Arithmetic".
