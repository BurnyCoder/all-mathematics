# Proof Theory

- **Mathematical Definition**: Proof theory is a major branch of mathematical logic that represents proofs as formal mathematical objects, facilitating their analysis by mathematical techniques. Proofs are typically presented as inductively-defined data structures such as plain lists, boxed lists, or trees, which are constructed according to the axioms and rules of inference of the logical system.

- **Description**: Proof theory is the study of the structure and properties of formal proofs. It analyzes the nature of mathematical proofs, proof systems, and the formalization of mathematics. The subject is syntactic in nature, in contrast to model theory, which is semantic in nature.

- **Subfields it's part of**:
    - [Mathematical Logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_logic): It is one of the four pillars of mathematical logic, along with set theory, model theory, and computability theory.
    - [Foundations of Mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_mathematics): It provides tools for analyzing the consistency and expressive power of mathematical theories.

- **Subfields and concepts it includes**:
    - **Structural Proof Theory**: Focuses on the structure of proofs and the properties of different proof calculi, such as sequent calculus, natural deduction, and Hilbert systems.
    - **Ordinal Analysis**: A technique for providing combinatorial consistency proofs for formal theories. It measures the strength of theories by assigning ordinals to them.
    - **Provability Logic**: A modal logic, in which the box operator is interpreted as 'it is provable that'. It is used to study the concept of provability within formal systems.
    - **Reverse Mathematics**: A program in mathematical logic that seeks to determine which axioms are required to prove specific theorems of mathematics.

- **Applications**:
    - **Automated Theorem Proving**: The development of computer programs that can automatically find proofs for mathematical theorems.
    - **Computer Science**: It has applications in programming language theory (through the Curry-Howard correspondence), formal verification, and artificial intelligence.
    - **Philosophy of Mathematics**: It informs debates about the nature of mathematical truth and the justification of mathematical axioms.

- **More Concrete Variants**:
    - **Natural Deduction**: A proof calculus that attempts to mirror the natural way mathematicians and logicians reason.
    - **Sequent Calculus**: A proof calculus that is particularly well-suited for structural analysis, such as cut-elimination.
    - **Hilbert Systems**: An axiomatic approach to logic that uses a minimal set of axioms and rules of inference.

- **More General Variants**:
    - There are no widely recognized "more general" variants of proof theory itself, as it is a broad field of study. However, one could consider different logical frameworks (like intuitionistic or linear logic) as providing different arenas for proof-theoretic analysis.

- **Related Concepts**:
    - **[First-Order Logic](./first_order_logic.md)**: Proof theory is often applied to first-order logic to study its properties.
    - **[GÃ¶del's Incompleteness Theorems](./godels_incompleteness_theorems.md)**: Proof theory provides the formal framework necessary to state and prove these theorems.
    - **[Lambda Calculus](../computability_theory/lambda_calculus.md)**: Through the Curry-Howard correspondence, proof theory is deeply connected to lambda calculus and type theory.
    - **[Type Theory](../type_theory/type_theory.md)**: The propositions-as-types paradigm establishes a direct correspondence between proofs in logic and programs in type theory.
