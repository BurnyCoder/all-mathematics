# Topos

- **Mathematical Definition**: A topos (plural: topoi or toposes) is a type of [category](../category_theory/category.md) that behaves like the category of sheaves of sets on a topological space. More abstractly, an elementary topos is a category that has finite limits, is cartesian closed, and has a subobject classifier.
    1.  **Finite Limits**: The category has a terminal object and pullbacks.
    2.  **Cartesian Closed**: For any two objects $A$ and $B$, there is an "exponential object" $B^A$, which behaves like the set of all morphisms from $A$ to $B$.
    3.  **Subobject Classifier**: There is an object $\Omega$ (the "truth-value object") and a morphism $\text{true}: 1 \to \Omega$ from the terminal object, such that for any monomorphism (subobject) $i: U \to A$, there is a unique characteristic morphism $\chi_i: A \to \Omega$ making a certain diagram a pullback.

- **Description**: Topos theory is a highly abstract field that unifies mathematical logic and geometry/topology. A topos can be thought of as a generalized "universe" of mathematical discourse. The category of sets is a topos, but many other categories are as well, such as the category of sheaves on a topological space. The internal logic of a topos is not necessarily classical logic; in general, it is intuitionistic logic. This means that a topos provides a framework for studying alternative mathematical realities where, for example, the law of the excluded middle might not hold.

- **Subfields it's part of**:
    - [Topos Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topos_theory): A topos is the central object of study in topos theory.
    - [Category Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory): Topos theory is a deep branch of category theory, and a topos is a special kind of category.
    - [Mathematical Logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_logic): Every topos has an internal logic (which is generally intuitionistic), making them objects of study in logic.
    - [Foundations of Mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_mathematics): Topos theory offers an alternative to set theory as a foundation for mathematics.

- **Subfields and concepts it includes**:
    - **Sheaf**: A tool for tracking locally defined data on a topological space.
    - **Subobject Classifier**: The object that plays the role of the set of truth values in the topos's internal logic.
    - **Internal Logic**: The logic (generally intuitionistic) that holds within a topos.

- **Applications**:
    - **Foundations of Mathematics**: Provides an alternative foundation to set theory.
    - **Mathematical Logic**: Used to construct models of intuitionistic logic and other non-classical logics.
    - **Theoretical Physics**: Used in attempts to formulate quantum gravity, where the state of the universe may be described by a topos.
    - **Algebraic Geometry**: The category of sheaves on a site is a fundamental example of a Grothendieck topos.

- **More Concrete Variants**:
    - **The Category of Sets (Set)**: The most familiar example of a topos.
    - **Category of Sheaves**: The category of sheaves of sets on a topological space.

- **More General Variants**:
    - **Higher Topos Theory**: The study of $(\infty, 1)$-toposes, which are a generalization of toposes to higher category theory.

- **Related Concepts**:
    - **[Category Theory](../category_theory/category.md)**: Topos theory is a branch of category theory.
    - **[Set Theory](../set_theory/set.md)**: The category of sets is the archetypal topos, and topos theory provides a general context that can be seen as an alternative to set-theoretic foundations.
    - **Intuitionistic Logic**: The internal logic of a general topos is intuitionistic.
