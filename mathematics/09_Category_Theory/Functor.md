# Functor

## Mathematical Definition

A **functor** is a map between [categories](./Category.md). It is a way of transforming one category into another while preserving the structure of the category.

Given two categories, \(C\) and \(D\), a **functor** \(F: C \to D\) consists of two mappings:
1.  **An object mapping:** A function that maps each object \(X\) in \(C\) to an object \(F(X)\) in \(D\).
2.  **A morphism mapping:** A function that maps each morphism \(f: X \to Y\) in \(C\) to a morphism \(F(f): F(X) \to F(Y)\) in \(D\).

These mappings must satisfy two conditions:
1.  **Preservation of identity morphisms:** For every object \(X\) in \(C\),
    \[ F(\text{id}_X) = \text{id}_{F(X)} \]
2.  **Preservation of composition of morphisms:** For any two morphisms \(f: X \to Y\) and \(g: Y \to Z\) in \(C\),
    \[ F(g \circ f) = F(g) \circ F(f) \]

This is the definition of a **covariant functor**. There is also a notion of a **contravariant functor**, which is similar but "reverses the arrows". A contravariant functor maps a morphism \(f: X \to Y\) to a morphism \(F(f): F(Y) \to F(X)\) and reverses the order of composition: \(F(g \circ f) = F(f) \circ F(g)\).

## Description

A functor is a structure-preserving map between categories, much like a group homomorphism is a structure-preserving map between groups. Functors can be thought of as "functions for categories". They are a central concept in category theory, allowing for the formal comparison and relation of different mathematical structures.

## Subfields it's part of

*   [Category Theory](./)

## Subfields and concepts it includes

*   **Endofunctor:** A functor from a category to itself.
*   **Forgetful Functor:** A functor that "forgets" some structure. For example, the functor from the category of groups **Grp** to the category of sets **Set** that maps a group to its underlying set.
*   **Free Functor:** A functor that is left adjoint to a forgetful functor. For example, the functor that maps a set to the free group generated by that set.
*   **Hom Functor:** A functor that maps a pair of objects to the set of morphisms between them. It is a fundamental tool in category theory.
*   **Full and Faithful Functors:** A functor is **faithful** if it is injective on morphisms between any two objects. It is **full** if it is surjective on morphisms.
*   **Isomorphism of Categories:** Two categories are isomorphic if there exist functors \(F: C \to D\) and \(G: D \to C\) that are mutually inverse.

## Applications

*   **Algebraic Topology:** The fundamental group and homology groups are classic examples of functors. They map a topological space (object in **Top**) to a group (object in **Grp**) and a continuous map (morphism in **Top**) to a group homomorphism (morphism in **Grp**). This allows topological problems to be translated into algebraic problems.
*   **Functional Programming:** Functors are a design pattern used to represent "containers" (like lists, options, etc.) that can be mapped over. The `map` function in many programming languages is an implementation of a functor.
*   **Representation Theory:** A representation of a group can be described as a functor from the group (viewed as a one-object category) to the category of vector spaces.
*   **Unifying Mathematical Concepts:** Functors show that different mathematical constructions are instances of the same general idea.

## More general variants

*   **Bifunctor:** A functor with two arguments.
*   **Profunctor:** A generalization of relations and functors.

## Everything else it relates to

*   **Natural Transformation:** A natural transformation is a map between two functors. Functors themselves can be seen as objects in a **functor category**.
*   **Adjoint Functors:** Adjoint functors are pairs of functors that are in a special relationship, capturing many dualities observed in mathematics.
*   **Universal Properties:** Many objects in mathematics are defined by a universal property, which can be elegantly expressed using functors (often as initial or terminal objects in some category).
