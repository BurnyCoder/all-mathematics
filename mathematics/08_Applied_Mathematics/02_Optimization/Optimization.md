# Optimization

## Mathematical Definition

**Mathematical optimization** (or mathematical programming) is the selection of a best element (with regard to some criterion) from some set of available alternatives.

An optimization problem consists of:
1.  An **objective function** \(f: A \to \mathbb{R}\) that we want to maximize or minimize.
2.  A set of **constraints**, which are equalities or inequalities that the solution must satisfy. The set of feasible solutions is the subset of \(A\) that satisfies the constraints.

The goal is to find an optimal solution \(x^*\) in the feasible set such that \(f(x^*)\) is a maximum or minimum.

Optimization problems can be classified based on the nature of the objective function and the constraints:
*   **Linear Programming:** The objective function and the constraints are linear.
*   **Nonlinear Programming:** The objective function or the constraints contain nonlinear parts.
*   **Integer Programming:** Some or all of the variables are restricted to be integers.
*   **Convex Optimization:** The objective function is a convex function, and the feasible set is a convex set. This is a special case of nonlinear programming that has efficient solution methods.

## Description

Optimization is the process of finding the best possible solution to a problem. This "best" solution is determined by an objective function, which we aim to either maximize (e.g., profit, performance, happiness) or minimize (e.g., cost, risk, error). The search for the best solution is often limited by a set of constraints or rules. Optimization is a central tool in decision-making and the analysis of physical systems.

## Subfields it's part of

*   [Applied Mathematics](../)
*   Operations Research
*   Computer Science (especially Machine Learning and Algorithm Design)
*   Control Theory

## Subfields and concepts it includes

*   **Gradient Descent:** A first-order iterative optimization algorithm for finding the local minimum of a differentiable function. It is a cornerstone of machine learning.
*   **Simplex Method:** An algorithm for solving linear programming problems.
*   **Lagrange Multipliers:** A method for finding the local maxima and minima of a function subject to equality constraints.
*   **Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) Conditions:** A generalization of Lagrange multipliers to problems with inequality constraints.
*   **Duality:** In optimization theory, duality means that optimization problems may be viewed from either of two perspectives, the primal problem or the dual problem. The solution to the dual problem provides a bound on the solution of the primal problem.
*   **Stochastic Optimization:** Optimization methods for problems that involve randomness.
*   **Dynamic Programming:** A method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems.

## Applications

*   **Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence:** Training models (e.g., neural networks, support vector machines) is a process of minimizing a "loss" or "cost" function.
*   **Logistics and Supply Chain Management:** Finding the most efficient routes for delivery (the Traveling Salesman Problem is a famous optimization problem), scheduling, and inventory management.
*   **Engineering:** Design optimization (e.g., finding the shape of an aircraft wing that maximizes lift and minimizes drag), control systems, and resource allocation.
*   **Finance:** Portfolio optimization (finding the allocation of assets that maximizes return for a given level of risk).
*   **Economics:** Modeling the behavior of consumers (maximizing utility) and firms (maximizing profit).

## More general variants

*   **Calculus of Variations:** A field of analysis that deals with maximizing or minimizing functionals, which are mappings from a set of functions to the real numbers.
*   **Optimal Control:** A generalization of the calculus of variations that includes constraints on the control variables.

## More concrete variants

*   **Least Squares:** A standard approach in regression analysis to approximate the solution of overdetermined systems by minimizing the sum of the squares of the residuals.
*   **Shortest Path Problem:** Finding the shortest path between two nodes in a graph.

## Everything else it relates to

*   **Calculus:** Derivatives are used to find the optima of functions (e.g., by setting the gradient to zero).
*   **Linear Algebra:** Many optimization algorithms rely on solving systems of linear equations.
*   **Graph Theory:** Many optimization problems, like the shortest path problem or the maximum flow problem, are defined on graphs.
*   **Computational Complexity Theory:** The study of the difficulty of solving optimization problems (e.g., the P vs. NP problem).
