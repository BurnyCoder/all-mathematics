# Group

## Mathematical Definition

A **group** is a fundamental algebraic structure consisting of a [set](../../../../00_Foundations/01_Set_Theory/Set.md) \(G\) equipped with a binary operation \(\cdot\) that combines any two elements \(a\) and \(b\) to form another element, denoted \(a \cdot b\), such that the following four axioms are satisfied:

1.  **Closure:** For all \(a, b\) in \(G\), the result of the operation, \(a \cdot b\), is also in \(G\).
2.  **Associativity:** For all \(a, b, c\) in \(G\), \((a \cdot b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c)\).
3.  **Identity Element:** There exists an element \(e\) in \(G\) such that for every element \(a\) in \(G\), the equation \(e \cdot a = a \cdot e = a\) holds. Such an element is unique and is called the **identity element**.
4.  **Inverse Element:** For each element \(a\) in \(G\), there exists an element \(b\) in \(G\), called the **inverse** of \(a\), such that \(a \cdot b = b \cdot a = e\), where \(e\) is the identity element. The inverse of \(a\) is usually denoted \(a^{-1}\).

The pair \((G, \cdot)\) is used to denote a group.

## Description

A group is a set with an operation that satisfies a few minimal, but powerful, axioms. The concept of a group is central to abstract algebra and captures the essence of symmetry. It allows for the formal study of the symmetries of mathematical and physical objects.

## Subfields it's part of

*   [Group Theory](./)
*   [Abstract Algebra](../)
*   Virtually all fields of mathematics.

## Subfields and concepts it includes

*   **Subgroup:** A subset of a group \(G\) that itself forms a group under the same operation.
*   **Abelian Group (or Commutative Group):** A group in which the operation is commutative, i.e., \(a \cdot b = b \cdot a\) for all \(a, b\) in \(G\).
*   **Cyclic Group:** A group that can be generated by a single element.
*   **Group Homomorphism:** A [function](../../../../00_Foundations/01_Set_Theory/Function.md) between two groups that preserves the group structure.
*   **Isomorphism:** A bijective homomorphism. Two groups are isomorphic if they have the same structure.
*   **Order of a Group:** The number of elements in the group (its cardinality).
*   **Order of an Element:** The smallest positive integer \(n\) such that \(a^n = e\), where \(e\) is the identity element.
*   **Lagrange's Theorem:** A fundamental theorem stating that for any finite group \(G\), the order of every subgroup of \(G\) divides the order of \(G\).
*   **Normal Subgroup and Quotient Group:** A normal subgroup is a subgroup that is invariant under conjugation. Quotient groups are formed by "factoring out" a normal subgroup.

## Applications

*   **Symmetry:** Groups are used to describe the symmetries of objects. For example, the symmetry group of a geometric object is the group of all transformations under which the object is invariant.
*   **Physics:** Group theory is essential in modern physics. For example, the Standard Model of particle physics is described using Lie groups. It is also used in crystallography to classify crystal structures.
*   **Cryptography:** Public-key cryptography often uses groups, especially finite cyclic groups (e.g., elliptic curve cryptography).
*   **Chemistry:** Used to classify the symmetries of molecules, which helps in understanding their physical and spectroscopic properties.
*   **Rubik's Cube:** The set of all possible moves on a Rubik's Cube forms a group.

## More general variants

*   **Monoid:** A set with an associative binary operation and an identity element (drops the inverse element axiom).
*   **Semigroup:** A set with an associative binary operation (drops identity and inverse axioms).
*   **Magma (or Groupoid):** A set with a binary operation (drops associativity, identity, and inverse).
*   **Quantum Group:** A Hopf algebra, which is a generalization of a group.
*   **Group Object:** A generalization of a group in category theory.

## More concrete variants

*   **Finite Groups:** Groups with a finite number of elements.
    *   **Symmetric Group \(S_n\):** The group of all permutations of a set of \(n\) elements.
    *   **Dihedral Group \(D_n\):** The group of symmetries of a regular polygon with \(n\) sides.
*   **Infinite Groups:**
    *   **The Integers under Addition \((\mathbb{Z}, +)\):** A simple example of an infinite, cyclic, abelian group.
*   **Lie Groups:** Groups that are also differentiable manifolds, with the group operations being smooth. They are used to describe continuous symmetry. Examples include the group of rotations in 3D space, SO(3).
*   **Matrix Groups:** Groups whose elements are invertible matrices and the operation is matrix multiplication (e.g., the general linear group \(GL(n)\)).

## Everything else it relates to

*   **Fields and Rings:** These are other algebraic structures with two operations. A field is a set where the non-zero elements form a group under multiplication.
*   **Representation Theory:** The study of abstract groups via their representations as linear transformations of vector spaces.
*   **Galois Theory:** Uses group theory to study the symmetries of the roots of polynomial equations.
