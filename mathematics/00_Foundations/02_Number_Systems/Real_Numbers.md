# Real Numbers

## Mathematical Definition

The **real numbers**, denoted by \(\mathbb{R}\), are the set of numbers that can be represented as points on an infinitely long number line. This includes the [rational numbers](./Rational_Numbers.md) and the **irrational numbers** (numbers that cannot be expressed as a fraction of two integers, such as \(\sqrt{2}\) and \(\pi\)).

The real numbers are formally defined as the **completion** of the rational numbers \(\mathbb{Q}\) with respect to the standard absolute value metric. This means that every Cauchy sequence of rational numbers converges to a real number. Two common constructions are:

1.  **Dedekind Cuts:** A real number is defined as a partition of the rational numbers \(\mathbb{Q}\) into two non-empty sets \(A\) and \(B\) such that every element of \(A\) is less than every element of \(B\), and \(A\) contains no greatest element.
2.  **Cauchy Sequences:** A real number is defined as an equivalence class of Cauchy sequences of rational numbers. Two sequences are equivalent if their difference converges to 0.

## Description

The real numbers form a continuous number line. They "fill in the gaps" between the rational numbers. The key property of the real numbers is their **completeness**, meaning there are no gaps or holes on the number line. This property is crucial for calculus and analysis.

## Subfields it's part of

*   [Number Systems](./)
*   [Analysis](../../../02_Analysis/) (especially [Real Analysis](../../../02_Analysis/01_Real_Analysis/))
*   [Geometry](../../../03_Geometry/)
*   [Topology](../../../04_Topology/)

## Subfields and concepts it includes

*   **Rational and Irrational Numbers**
    *   **Algebraic Numbers:** Roots of polynomial equations with integer coefficients (includes all rationals and some irrationals like \(\sqrt{2}\)).
    *   **Transcendental Numbers:** Irrational numbers that are not algebraic, such as \(\pi\) and \(e\).
*   **Completeness Axiom (or a Dedekind-complete ordered field)**
*   **Limits, Continuity, Differentiation, Integration (Calculus)**
*   **Sequences and Series**
*   **The Continuum:** The set of real numbers is also known as the continuum.

## Applications

*   **Calculus and Mathematical Analysis:** The completeness of \(\mathbb{R}\) is the foundation for the theory of limits, which underlies all of calculus.
*   **Physics and Engineering:** Modeling continuous quantities like time, distance, velocity, energy, etc.
*   **Geometry:** The coordinates of points in Euclidean space are real numbers.
*   **Computer Science:** Floating-point numbers are a finite approximation of real numbers.
*   **Statistics and Probability:** Continuous probability distributions are defined over the real numbers.

## More general variants

*   [Complex Numbers](./Complex_Numbers.md): \(\mathbb{C}\)
*   **Hyperreal Numbers:** An extension of the real numbers that includes infinitesimal and infinite numbers.
*   **Surreal Numbers:** A number system that includes the reals as well as infinite and infinitesimal numbers.
*   **Quaternions and Octonions:** Number systems that extend the complex numbers.

## More concrete variants

*   [Rational Numbers](./Rational_Numbers.md)
*   [Integers](./Integers.md)
*   [Natural Numbers](./Natural_Numbers.md)
*   **Algebraic and Transcendental Numbers**

## Everything else it relates to

*   **Uncountability:** The set of real numbers is uncountably infinite, which was famously proven by Cantor's diagonal argument.
*   **Metric Spaces:** The real line is a fundamental example of a complete metric space.
*   **Measure Theory:** The concept of length, area, and volume is formalized using measure theory on the real numbers.
*   **Continuum Hypothesis:** A famous hypothesis in set theory concerning the cardinality of the set of real numbers.
