# Topological Space

## Mathematical Definition

A **topological space** is the most general type of mathematical space that allows for the definition of concepts such as continuity, connectedness, and convergence. It is a [set](../../../00_Foundations/01_Set_Theory/Set.md) of points, along with a set of **neighbourhoods** for each point, that satisfy a set of axioms relating points and neighbourhoods.

More formally, a topological space is an ordered pair \((X, \tau)\), where \(X\) is a set and \(\tau\) is a collection of subsets of \(X\), called **open sets**, satisfying the following three axioms:

1.  The empty set \(\emptyset\) and the entire set \(X\) are in \(\tau\).
    \[ \emptyset \in \tau \quad \text{and} \quad X \in \tau \]
2.  The union of any arbitrary collection of sets in \(\tau\) is also in \(\tau\). (Arbitrary unions of open sets are open).
    \[ \text{If } \{U_i\}_{i \in I} \subseteq \tau, \text{ then } \bigcup_{i \in I} U_i \in \tau \]
3.  The intersection of any finite collection of sets in \(\tau\) is also in \(\tau\). (Finite intersections of open sets are open).
    \[ \text{If } \{U_i\}_{i=1}^n \subseteq \tau, \text{ then } \bigcap_{i=1}^n U_i \in \tau \]

The collection \(\tau\) is called a **topology** on \(X\). The elements of \(X\) are usually called **points**, and the sets in \(\tau\) are called the **open sets**. A subset of \(X\) is called **closed** if its complement is an open set.

## Description

A topological space is an extremely general and abstract concept. It provides just enough structure to define the notion of "nearness" of points, which in turn allows for the definition of continuous functions. Unlike a [metric space](../../../03_Geometry/00_Euclidean_Geometry/Euclidean_Space.md), a topological space does not need to have a concept of distance. Topology is the study of properties of these spaces that are invariant under continuous deformations (homeomorphisms), such as connectedness and compactness.

## Subfields it's part of

*   [Topology](./)
*   [Functional Analysis](../../../02_Analysis/03_Functional_Analysis/)
*   [Algebraic Topology](../)
*   [Differential Geometry](../../../03_Geometry/01_Differential_Geometry/)

## Subfields and concepts it includes

*   **Open and Closed Sets**
*   **Basis for a Topology:** A smaller collection of open sets from which the entire topology can be generated.
*   **Continuous Functions (Homeomorphisms):** A function between two topological spaces is continuous if the preimage of every open set is open. A homeomorphism is a continuous, bijective function whose inverse is also continuous.
*   **Separation Axioms (e.g., Hausdorff Space):** Properties that describe how "separated" points or closed sets are from each other.
*   **Compactness:** A property that generalizes the idea of a closed and bounded subset of Euclidean space.
*   **Connectedness:** A property that formalizes the idea of a space being "all in one piece".
*   **Subspace Topology:** A natural way to give a topology to a subset of a topological space.
*   **Product Topology:** A way to define a topology on the Cartesian product of topological spaces.

## Applications

*   **Analysis:** Provides a general setting for the study of continuity and convergence.
*   **Algebraic Topology:** Uses tools from abstract algebra (like [groups](../../../01_Algebra/01_Abstract_Algebra/00_Group_Theory/Group.md)) to study topological spaces. It helps in distinguishing different topological spaces by finding invariants.
*   **Differential Geometry:** The study of [manifolds](../../../03_Geometry/00_Euclidean_Geometry/Euclidean_Space.md) is based on topological spaces that are locally Euclidean.
*   **Data Analysis (Topological Data Analysis - TDA):** A relatively new field that uses topological concepts to analyze the "shape" of complex, high-dimensional data.
*   **Physics:** Used in quantum field theory and general relativity to describe the structure of spacetime.
*   **Knot Theory:** The study of mathematical knots is a part of topology.

## More general variants

*   The concept of a topological space is already very general. Further generalizations often relax the axioms, for example:
    *   **Locale:** A point-free approach to topology.
    *   **Convergence Space:** A set with a notion of convergence of sequences or nets, which is more general than that of a topological space.

## More concrete variants

*   **Metric Space:** A space with a distance function. Every metric space is a topological space, where the open sets are generated by open balls.
*   **Manifold:** A topological space that is locally homeomorphic to Euclidean space.
*   **Discrete Topology:** The topology where every subset is open.
*   **Indiscrete (or Trivial) Topology:** The topology where the only open sets are the empty set and the entire space.
*   **Order Topology:** A topology that can be defined on any totally ordered set.

## Everything else it relates to

*   **Set Theory:** The definition is purely in terms of set theory.
*   **Geometry:** Topology is a generalization of geometry where the concept of shape is studied in a more flexible way (often called "rubber sheet geometry").
*   **Category Theory:** Topological spaces and continuous maps form a category called **Top**.
