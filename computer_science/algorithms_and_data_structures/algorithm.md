# Algorithm

- **Mathematical Definition**: While there is no single universally accepted formal definition, an algorithm is typically understood as a finite sequence of well-defined, computer-implementable instructions to solve a class of problems or to perform a computation. From a theoretical standpoint, algorithms are often formalized using models of computation like the **Turing machine**. A Turing machine provides a mathematical model of a general-purpose computer and an algorithm is a Turing machine that halts for all inputs.

- **Description**: An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure for calculations. Algorithms are used for calculation, data processing, and automated reasoning. They are the core of computer science, providing the blueprint for how software performs its tasks. The study of algorithms involves their design, analysis (for correctness and efficiency), and implementation.

- **Subfields and concepts it includes**:
    - **Computational Complexity**: The study of the resources (like time and memory) required by an algorithm. Concepts include Big O notation.
    - **Correctness**: Proving that an algorithm produces the correct output for all valid inputs.
    - **Computability**: The study of whether a problem can be solved with an algorithm at all.
    - **Data Structures**: The way data is organized and stored, which is crucial for the design of efficient algorithms.

- **Applications**:
    - **Everywhere in computing**: From sorting data in a spreadsheet and searching the web (e.g., Google's PageRank) to rendering graphics and processing financial transactions.
    - **Machine Learning**: Algorithms like gradient descent are used to train models.
    - **Cryptography**: Algorithms for encryption and decryption secure digital communication.
    - **Operations Research**: Algorithms for optimization, scheduling, and logistics.

- **More Concrete Variants**:
    - **Sorting Algorithms**: (e.g., Quicksort, Mergesort)
    - **Searching Algorithms**: (e.g., Binary Search, Breadth-First Search)
    - **Graph Algorithms**: (e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest paths)
    - **Randomized Algorithms**: Algorithms that employ a degree of randomness as part of their logic.
    - **Greedy Algorithms**: Algorithms that make a locally optimal choice at each step.

- **More General Variants**:
    - **Heuristic**: An approach to problem solving that employs a practical method not guaranteed to be optimal or perfect, but sufficient for the immediate goals.
    - **Metaheuristic**: A high-level procedure or heuristic designed to find, generate, or select a heuristic that may provide a sufficiently good solution to an optimization problem.
