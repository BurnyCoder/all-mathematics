# Manifold

- **Mathematical Definition**: An \\(n\\)-dimensional manifold is a [topological space](../topology/topological_space.md) that is locally homeomorphic to Euclidean \\(n\\)-space (\\(\mathbb{R}^n\\)). This means that for every point on the manifold, there exists a neighborhood around it that is topologically equivalent to an open ball in \\(\mathbb{R}^n\\). A **differentiable manifold** is a manifold equipped with a globally consistent differentiable structure, which allows for the definitions of tangent spaces and calculus.

- **Description**: A manifold is a space that "looks like" Euclidean space on a small scale, but may have a more complicated global structure. For example, the surface of the Earth is a 2-dimensional manifold; locally it looks like a flat plane (a piece of \\(\mathbb{R}^2\\)), but globally it is a sphere. Manifolds are the central objects of study in differential geometry and provide the mathematical framework for describing curved spaces.

- **Subfields it's part of**:
    - [Differential Geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry)
    - [Topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology)
    - [Pure Mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_mathematics)

- **Subfields and concepts it includes**:
    - **Chart**: A coordinate system for a local neighborhood of the manifold.
    - **Atlas**: A collection of charts that covers the entire manifold.
    - **Tangent Space**: A vector space attached to each point on a differentiable manifold that consists of the possible directions of curves passing through that point.
    - **Metric Tensor**: A function that defines a notion of distance and angle on the manifold, turning it into a Riemannian manifold.
    - **Curvature**: The mathematical description of how a manifold deviates from being flat.

- **Applications**:
    - **General Relativity**: Spacetime is modeled as a 4-dimensional pseudo-Riemannian manifold, where the curvature of the manifold represents gravity.
    - **Robotics**: The configuration space of a robot (the set of all its possible positions) is often a manifold.
    - **Computer Graphics**: Manifolds are used to represent smooth surfaces.
    - **Data Analysis**: Manifold learning is a technique in machine learning that assumes high-dimensional data lies on a lower-dimensional manifold.

- **More Concrete Variants**:
    - **Sphere (\\(S^n\\))**: The n-dimensional surface of a ball in \\((n+1)\\)-dimensional space.
    - **Torus**: A donut-shaped surface.
    - **Lie Group**: A group that is also a differentiable manifold.

- **More General Variants**:
    - **Orbifold**: A generalization of a manifold that allows for certain kinds of singularities.
    - **Banach Manifold**: A manifold modeled on Banach spaces instead of Euclidean space.

- **Related Concepts**:
    - **[Topological Space](../topology/topological_space.md)**: A manifold is a special kind of topological space.
    - **[Vector Space](../algebra/vector_space.md)**: The tangent space at each point of a differentiable manifold is a vector space.
    - **Einstein's Field Equations**: These equations relate the curvature of the spacetime manifold to the distribution of matter and energy.
