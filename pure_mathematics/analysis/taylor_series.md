# Taylor Series

- **Mathematical Definition**: A Taylor series is a representation of a function as an infinite sum of terms, where each term is calculated from the values of the function's derivatives at a single point. For a function \\(f(x)\\) that is infinitely differentiable at a point \\(a\\), its Taylor series centered at \\(a\\) is the power series:
  \\( \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!} (x-a)^n = f(a) + f'(a)(x-a) + \frac{f''(a)}{2!}(x-a)^2 + \frac{f'''(a)}{3!}(x-a)^3 + \cdots \\)
  where \\(f^{(n)}(a)\\) denotes the \\(n\\)-th derivative of \\(f\\) evaluated at the point \\(a\\), and \\(n!\\) is the factorial of \\(n\\). If \\(a=0\\), the series is called a **Maclaurin series**.

- **Description**: The Taylor series provides a way to approximate a function with a polynomial. By taking a finite number of terms from the series (a Taylor polynomial), one can often get a very good approximation of the function near the center point \\(a\\). This is one of the most powerful tools in mathematical analysis and applied mathematics, allowing complex functions to be replaced by simpler polynomials for the purpose of calculation.

    - [Calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus)

- **Subfields and concepts it includes**:
    - **Taylor Polynomial**: A finite truncation of the Taylor series.
    - **Radius of Convergence**: The range of \\(x\\) values for which the infinite series converges to the function.
    - **Analytic Function**: A function that is equal to its Taylor series in a neighborhood of every point.

- **Applications**:
    - **Physics and Engineering**: Used to linearize equations and approximate the behavior of systems near an equilibrium point. For example, the small-angle approximation (\\(\sin \theta \approx \theta\\)) is the first term of the Taylor series for the sine function.
    - **Numerical Analysis**: Taylor polynomials are the basis for many methods of numerical integration and for solving differential equations.
    - **Computer Science**: Used in calculators and computer programs to evaluate trigonometric, exponential, and other transcendental functions.
    - **Optimization**: Used to approximate objective functions in optimization algorithms (e.g., Newton's method).

- **More Concrete Variants**:
    - **Maclaurin Series**: A Taylor series centered at \\(a=0\\).
    - **Common Taylor Series**: Famous expansions for \\(e^x\\), \\(\sin x\\), \\(\cos x\\), and \\(\log(1+x)\\).

- **More General Variants**:
    - **Laurent Series**: Generalizes the Taylor series to functions that may have singularities. It includes terms with negative powers.
    - **Taylor's Theorem in Multiple Variables**: An extension of the concept to functions of multiple variables.

- **Related Concepts**:
    - **[Derivative](./derivative.md)**: The coefficients of the Taylor series are calculated from the derivatives of the function.
    - **Power Series**: A Taylor series is a specific type of power series.
    - **Approximation Theory**: The study of how functions can be approximated by simpler functions.
