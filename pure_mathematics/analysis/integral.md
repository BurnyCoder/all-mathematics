# Integral

- **Mathematical Definition**: An integral is a mathematical object that can be interpreted as an area or a generalization of area. The most common type is the **definite integral**. For a function \\(f(x)\\) of one variable, the definite integral from \\(a\\) to \\(b\\) is written
  \\( \int_a^b f(x) \,dx \\)
  It is defined as the limit of Riemann sums of areas of rectangles that approximate the region under the curve. This is the **Riemann integral**. The **Fundamental Theorem of Calculus** provides a link between integration and differentiation: if \\(F\\) is an antiderivative of \\(f\\) (i.e., \\(F' = f\\)), then \\(\int_a^b f(x) \,dx = F(b) - F(a)\\).

- **Description**: The integral is the second central concept of calculus. The process of finding an integral is called **integration**. Where differentiation deals with instantaneous rates of change, integration deals with the accumulation of quantities. It is the reverse process of differentiation, a fact captured by the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.

- **Subfields and concepts it includes**:
    - **Riemann Sum**: An approximation of the area under a curve using a sum of rectangles.
    - **Antiderivative**: A function whose derivative is the original function.
    - **Indefinite Integral**: The set of all antiderivatives of a function.
    - **Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**: The theorem connecting differentiation and integration.
    - **Integration Techniques**: Methods for finding integrals (e.g., integration by substitution, integration by parts).

- **Applications**:
    - **Geometry**: Calculating areas, volumes, and arc lengths.
    - **Physics**: Calculating work, total displacement, center of mass, and moments of inertia.
    - **Probability Theory**: The probability of a continuous random variable falling within a certain range is the integral of its probability density function.
    - **Engineering**: Calculating the total amount of a quantity that accumulates over time, such as the total charge in a capacitor.

- **More Concrete Variants**:
    - **Line Integral**: An integral where the function to be integrated is evaluated along a curve.
    - **Surface Integral**: A generalization of multiple integrals to integration over surfaces.
    - **Volume Integral**: An integral over a 3-dimensional domain.

- **More General Variants**:
    - **Lebesgue Integral**: A more powerful and general definition of the integral, which can handle a wider class of functions. It is central to measure theory.
    - **Stochastic Integral**: An integral with respect to a stochastic process, used in stochastic calculus.

    - **[Derivative](./derivative.md)**: Integration is the inverse operation of differentiation.
    - **Measure Theory**: Provides the foundation for the more general Lebesgue integral.
    - **Summation**: The integral can be seen as a continuous analogue of a sum.
