# Real Number

- **Mathematical Definition**: The real numbers, denoted by $\mathbb{R}$, are a set of numbers that can be used to measure any continuous one-dimensional quantity. They can be formally defined as the completion of the rational numbers ($\mathbb{Q}$) with respect to the standard absolute value metric. This means they include all rational numbers, such as integers (e.g., -5, 0, 2) and fractions (e.g., 1/2, 22/7), as well as all irrational numbers (e.g., $\sqrt{2}$, $\pi$, $e$).

    A key property is that the real numbers form a **complete ordered field**.
    - **Field**: They satisfy the field axioms (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division are well-behaved).
    - **Ordered**: They are totally ordered by $\le$, and this order is compatible with the field operations.
    - **Complete**: Every non-empty set of real numbers that has an upper bound has a least upper bound (supremum) in the set. This is the **least upper bound property**.

- **Description**: Real numbers are the foundation of calculus and real analysis. They correspond to points on an infinitely long line, called the number line. The "completeness" property is what distinguishes them from the rational numbers; it ensures there are no "gaps" on the number line, which is crucial for the concepts of limits and continuity.

- **Subfields it's part of**:
    - [Real Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_analysis): The real numbers are the central object of study.
    - [Number Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory): Studies properties of numbers, including reals.
    - [Algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_algebra): The real numbers form a field.

- **Subfields and concepts it includes**:
    - **Rational Numbers**: The subset of real numbers that can be expressed as a ratio of two integers.
    - **Irrational Numbers**: The subset of real numbers that cannot be expressed as a ratio of two integers.
    - **Transcendental Numbers**: A subset of irrational numbers that are not the root of any non-zero polynomial equation with integer coefficients (e.g., $\pi$, $e$).
    - **Dedekind Cuts**: A formal construction of the real numbers from the rational numbers.
    - **Cauchy Sequences**: Another formal construction of the real numbers, based on sequences of rational numbers that get arbitrarily close to each other.

- **Applications**:
    - **Virtually all of Science and Engineering**: Used to model continuous quantities like time, distance, temperature, energy, etc.
    - **Physics**: Describing space-time, physical constants, and measurements.
    - **Computer Science**: Floating-point numbers are an approximation of real numbers used in scientific computing and graphics.
    - **Finance**: Modeling continuous growth, interest rates, and stock prices.

- **More Concrete Variants**:
    - **Integers ($\mathbb{Z}$)**
    - **Rational Numbers ($\mathbb{Q}$)**
    - **Algebraic Numbers** (roots of polynomials with integer coefficients)

- **More General Variants**:
    - **Complex Numbers ($\mathbb{C}$)**: Extend the real numbers with the imaginary unit $i$.
    - **Hyperreal Numbers**: An extension of the real numbers that includes infinitesimal and infinite numbers.
    - **Surreal Numbers**: A vast extension of the real numbers that also includes infinitesimals and infinite numbers.
