# Derivative

- **Mathematical Definition**: The derivative of a function of a real variable measures the instantaneous rate of change of the function with respect to its variable. It is defined as a limit. For a function $f(x)$, the derivative at a point $a$, denoted $f'(a)$, is:
$$ f'(a) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h} $$
  provided the limit exists. Geometrically, the derivative at a point is the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the function at that point.

- **Description**: The derivative is a cornerstone of calculus and mathematical analysis. The process of finding a derivative is called **differentiation**. It provides a way to describe how a function is changing at any given point. This concept is fundamental to modeling dynamic systems in all of science and engineering.

- **Subfields it's part of**:
    - [Calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus): The derivative is one of the two fundamental concepts of calculus, along with the integral.
    - [Differential Calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_calculus): The derivative is the central object of study in differential calculus.
    - [Mathematical Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis): The rigorous definition and properties of the derivative are a core part of mathematical analysis.

- **Subfields and concepts it includes**:
    - **Tangent Line**: The geometric interpretation of the derivative.
    - **Rate of Change**: The physical interpretation of the derivative.
    - **Differentiation Rules**: Techniques for computing derivatives (e.g., product rule, quotient rule, chain rule).
    - **Higher-Order Derivatives**: The result of differentiating a function more than once.
    - **Partial Derivative**: The derivative of a multivariable function with respect to one of its variables, holding the others constant.

- **Applications**:
    - **Physics**: Velocity and acceleration are the first and second derivatives of position with respect to time.
    - **Optimization**: Finding maxima and minima of functions by finding points where the derivative is zero. This is used everywhere from engineering design to financial modeling.
    - **Economics**: Used to find marginal cost and marginal revenue.
    - **Machine Learning**: The process of training neural networks (gradient descent) relies on computing the gradient, which is a vector of partial derivatives.
    - **Differential Equations**: Equations involving an unknown function and its derivatives.

- **More Concrete Variants**:
    - **Partial Derivative**: For functions of multiple variables.
    - **Directional Derivative**: The rate of change of a multivariable function along a specific vector.
    - **Total Derivative**: The full derivative of a multivariable function, taking all variable changes into account.

- **More General Variants**:
    - **Fr√©chet Derivative**: A generalization of the derivative to functions between Banach spaces.
    - **Weak Derivative**: A concept from functional analysis that allows for differentiation of functions that are not differentiable in the classical sense.
