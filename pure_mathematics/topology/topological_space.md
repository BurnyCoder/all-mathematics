# Topological Space

- **Mathematical Definition**: A topological space is an ordered pair \\((X, \tau)\\), where \\(X\\) is a set and \\(\tau\\) is a collection of subsets of \\(X\\), called **open sets**, satisfying the following axioms:
    1.  The empty set \\(\emptyset\\) and the entire set \\(X\\) are in \\(\tau\\).
    2.  The union of any arbitrary collection of sets in \\(\tau\\) is also in \\(\tau\\).
    3.  The intersection of any finite collection of sets in \\(\tau\\) is also in \\(\tau\\).
The collection \\(\tau\\) is called a **topology** on \\(X\\). The complements of the open sets are called **closed sets**.

- **Description**: Topology is the mathematical study of the properties of geometric objects that are preserved under continuous deformations, such as stretching, twisting, crumbling, and bending, but not tearing or gluing. A topological space is the most general setting in which the intuitive concepts of "closeness" and "continuity" can be defined and studied. It abstracts the notion of distance found in metric spaces to a more fundamental notion of open neighborhoods.

- **Subfields it's part of**:
    - [Topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology)
    - [Pure Mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_mathematics)

- **Subfields and concepts it includes**:
    - **Open and Closed Sets**: The fundamental building blocks of a topology.
    - **Neighborhood**: A set containing an open set that contains a given point.
    - **Continuity**: A property of functions between topological spaces, defined in terms of preserving open sets.
    - **Compactness**: A property that generalizes the idea of a closed and bounded subset of Euclidean space.
    - **Connectedness**: A property that formalizes the idea of a space being a single, unbroken piece.
    - **Homeomorphism**: A continuous function between two topological spaces that has a continuous inverse. Two spaces are homeomorphic if they are topologically equivalent.
    - **Basis**: A collection of open sets that can generate the entire topology through unions.

- **Applications**:
    - **Mathematics**: Foundational for analysis, differential geometry, and algebraic topology. Used to study manifolds, knots, and function spaces.
    - **Physics**: Used in general relativity to describe the structure of spacetime, and in string theory and quantum field theory.
    - **Data Analysis**: Topological Data Analysis (TDA) is an emerging field that uses topological concepts to find structures in complex, high-dimensional data.
    - **Robotics**: Configuration spaces of robots are often described as topological spaces.

- **More Concrete Variants**:
    - **Metric Space**: A set with a distance function (a metric). Every metric space induces a topology, making it a topological space.
    - **Euclidean Space (\\(\mathbb{R}^n\\))**: A primary example of a metric space and thus a topological space.
    - **Discrete Topology**: The topology where every subset is open.
    - **Trivial (Indiscrete) Topology**: The topology containing only the empty set and the entire space.
    - **Manifold**: A topological space that locally resembles Euclidean space.

- **More General Variants**:
    - **Grothendieck Topology**: A generalization of the notion of a topology on a set to a category.
    - **Locale**: A more abstract formulation of the concept of a topological space based on the lattice of open sets.

- **Related Concepts**:
    - **[Set](../../foundations_of_mathematics/set_theory/set.md)**: A topological space is a set endowed with a specific structure (the topology).
    - **[Metric Space](../analysis/metric_space.md)**: A metric space is a more specific type of topological space where the topology is induced by a distance function.
    - **Continuous Function**: The notion of continuity is a central concept in the study of topological spaces.
