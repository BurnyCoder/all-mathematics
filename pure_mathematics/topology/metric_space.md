# Metric Space

- **Mathematical Definition**: A metric space is an ordered pair \\((M, d)\\), where \\(M\\) is a set and \\(d\\) is a **metric** (or distance function) on \\(M\\). The function \\(d: M \times M \to \mathbb{R}\\) must satisfy the following axioms for any \\(x, y, z \in M\\):
    1.  **Non-negativity**: \\(d(x, y) \ge 0\\).
    2.  **Identity of indiscernibles**: \\(d(x, y) = 0\\) if and only if \\(x = y\\).
    3.  **Symmetry**: \\(d(x, y) = d(y, x)\\).
    4.  **Triangle Inequality**: \\(d(x, z) \le d(x, y) + d(y, z)\\).

- **Description**: A metric space is a set equipped with a function that defines a concept of "distance" between any two elements of the set. This distance allows for the rigorous study of topological properties like convergence, continuity, and completeness in a very general setting. Every metric space naturally induces a [topological space](./topological_space.md), where the open sets are generated by open balls.

    - [Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis)

- **Subfields and concepts it includes**:
    - **Metric (Distance Function)**: The function defining distance.
    - **Open Ball**: The set of points within a certain distance of a given point.
    - **Convergence**: A sequence of points converges to a limit if the distance to the limit approaches zero.
    - **Cauchy Sequence**: A sequence where the elements become arbitrarily close to each other.
    - **Completeness**: A property of a metric space where every Cauchy sequence converges to a point within the space.

- **Applications**:
    - **Functional Analysis**: Spaces of functions are often defined as metric spaces (e.g., Banach spaces).
    - **General Relativity**: The curvature of spacetime is described by a metric tensor.
    - **Computer Science**: Used in algorithms for searching (e.g., nearest neighbor search), data mining, and machine learning to measure similarity or dissimilarity between data points.
    - **Numerical Analysis**: Used to analyze the convergence of algorithms.

- **More Concrete Variants**:
    - **Euclidean Space (\\(\mathbb{R}^n\\))**: The standard example with the usual Euclidean distance.
    - **Manhattan Distance**: A metric on \\(\mathbb{R}^n\\) defined as the sum of the absolute differences of their Cartesian coordinates.
    - **Discrete Metric**: A simple metric defined by \\(d(x, y) = 1\\) if \\(x \neq y\\) and \\(0\\) if \\(x = y\\).

- **More General Variants**:
    - **[Topological Space](./topological_space.md)**: A generalization that captures the notion of "closeness" without necessarily having a numerical distance.
    - **Uniform Space**: A space with a "uniform structure" that allows for defining uniform continuity; lies between metric spaces and topological spaces in generality.
    - **Pseudometric Space**: Relaxes the "identity of indiscernibles" axiom, allowing distinct points to have a distance of zero.

- **Related Concepts**:
    - **[Topological Space](./topological_space.md)**: Every metric space is a topological space.
    - **Normed Vector Space**: A [vector space](../algebra/vector_space.md) with a norm. Every norm induces a metric, so every normed vector space is a metric space.
    - **Banach Space**: A complete normed vector space.
