# Function

- **Mathematical Definition**: A function is a relation between a set of inputs (the **domain**) and a set of permissible outputs (the **codomain**) with the property that each input is related to exactly one output. If $f$ is a function with domain $A$ and codomain $B$, we write $f: A \to B$. For an input $x \in A$, the corresponding unique output in $B$ is denoted by $f(x)$.

- **Description**: Functions are a fundamental concept in mathematics and are essential for expressing relationships between quantities. They are used in every field of mathematics and science to model dependencies between variables.

- **Subfields it's part of**:
    - [Set Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory): Functions are formally defined as a special type of relation between sets.
    - [Calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus): Calculus is largely the study of functions, including their limits, derivatives, and integrals.

- **More Concrete Variants**:
    - **Polynomial Function**: A function defined by a polynomial, e.g., $f(x) = x^2 + 3x - 2$.
    - **Trigonometric Function**: Functions of an angle, important in studying triangles and modeling periodic phenomena (e.g., sin, cos, tan).
    - **Exponential Function**: A function of the form $f(x) = a^x$.
    - **Logarithmic Function**: The inverse of the exponential function.

- **Related Concepts**:
    - **[Set](../../foundations_of_mathematics/set_theory/set.md)**: The domain and codomain of a function are sets.
    - **[Relation](./relation.md)**: A function is a specific type of relation.
    - **[Derivative](../analysis/derivative.md)**: Measures the rate of change of a function.
    - **[Integral](../analysis/integral.md)**: Represents the accumulation of quantities, often related to the area under the curve of a function's graph.
