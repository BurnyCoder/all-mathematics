# Relation

- **Mathematical Definition**: A relation between two sets $A$ and $B$ is a subset of their Cartesian product $A \times B$. In other words, it is a collection of ordered pairs $(a, b)$ where $a \in A$ and $b \in B$. If $(a, b)$ is in the relation, we say that $a$ is related to $b$.

- **Description**: Relations are a fundamental concept used to describe connections between elements of sets. They are a generalization of functions; whereas a function must map each input to exactly one output, a relation can map an input to zero, one, or multiple outputs.

- **Subfields it's part of**:
    - [Set Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory): Relations are defined as subsets of the Cartesian product of sets.
    - [Discrete Mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_mathematics): The study of relations, especially on finite sets, is a core part of discrete mathematics.

- **More Concrete Variants**:
    - **Equivalence Relation**: A relation that is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive (e.g., equality, "is congruent to").
    - **Order Relation**: A relation that is reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive (e.g., "less than or equal to").
    - **Function**: A relation where each element in the domain is related to exactly one element in the codomain.

- **Related Concepts**:
    - **[Set](../../foundations_of_mathematics/set_theory/set.md)**: Relations are defined in terms of sets and Cartesian products.
    - **[Function](./function.md)**: A function is a specific, more constrained type of relation.
    - **[Graph Theory](../discrete_mathematics/graph_theory/graph.md)**: A directed graph can be seen as a visual representation of a relation on a set.
