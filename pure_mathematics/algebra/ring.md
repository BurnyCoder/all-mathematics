# Ring

- **Mathematical Definition**: A ring is a set $R$ equipped with two binary operations, typically denoted as addition ($+$) and multiplication ($\cdot$), satisfying the following axioms:
    1.  $(R, +)$ is an **abelian group**:
        - **Closure under addition**: For all $a, b \in R$, $a+b \in R$.
        - **Associativity of addition**: $(a+b)+c = a+(b+c)$.
        - **Identity element of addition**: There exists an element $0 \in R$ such that $a+0 = a$ for all $a \in R$.
        - **Inverse element of addition**: For each $a \in R$, there exists $-a \in R$ such that $a+(-a) = 0$.
        - **Commutativity of addition**: $a+b = b+a$.
    2.  $(R, \cdot)$ is a **[monoid](./monoid.md)** (in many definitions, though some authors only require a [semigroup](./semigroup.md)):
        - **Closure under multiplication**: For all $a, b \in R$, $a \cdot b \in R$.
        - **Associativity of multiplication**: $(a \cdot b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c)$.
    3.  **Distributivity**: Multiplication distributes over addition. For all $a, b, c \in R$:
        - $a \cdot (b+c) = (a \cdot b) + (a \cdot c)$ (left distributivity).
        - $(b+c) \cdot a = (b \cdot a) + (c \cdot a)$ (right distributivity).

- **Description**: Rings are fundamental algebraic structures that generalize the arithmetic of the integers. They consist of a set with two operations that behave like addition and multiplication, though with fewer restrictions than standard arithmetic (for instance, multiplication need not be commutative, and multiplicative inverses may not exist). The study of rings is known as ring theory.

- **Subfields it's part of**:
    - [Ring Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_theory): A ring is the fundamental object of study in ring theory.
    - [Abstract Algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_algebra): Ring theory is a major branch of abstract algebra, alongside group theory and field theory.
    - [Pure Mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_mathematics): Rings are one of the fundamental algebraic structures studied in pure mathematics.

- **Subfields and concepts it includes**:
    - **Subring**: A subset of a ring that is itself a ring under the same operations.
    - **Ideal**: A special type of subring that plays a role analogous to normal subgroups in group theory.
    - **Ring Homomorphism**: A function between rings that preserves both the addition and multiplication operations.
    - **Quotient Ring**: A ring formed from a ring and one of its ideals.

- **Applications**:
    - **Number Theory**: The integers $\mathbb{Z}$ and integers modulo $n$ ($\mathbb{Z}_n$) are cornerstone examples of rings.
    - **Algebraic Geometry**: The study of geometric objects defined by polynomial equations. The set of polynomials over a field forms a ring.
    - **Functional Analysis**: Rings of functions are studied.
    - **Cryptography**: Rings, particularly polynomial rings over finite fields, are used in various cryptographic systems.

- **More Concrete Variants**:
    - **Commutative Ring**: A ring where multiplication is commutative.
    - **Ring with Unity**: A ring that has a multiplicative identity element (often denoted $1$).
    - **Integral Domain**: A non-trivial commutative ring with unity where the product of any two non-zero elements is non-zero.
    - **Field**: A non-trivial commutative ring with unity in which every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse.
    - **Polynomial Ring**: The ring formed by polynomials with coefficients in another ring.
    - **Matrix Ring**: The ring of square matrices over a ring.

- **More General Variants**:
    - **Semiring**: Relaxes the requirement that $(R, +)$ be an abelian group to only being a commutative monoid.
    - **Near-ring**: A structure where addition is not necessarily commutative and only one of the distributive laws holds.

- **Related Concepts**:
    - **[Group](./group.md)**: A ring's structure under addition is an abelian group.
    - **[Field](./field.md)**: A field is a special, more structured type of ring. Every field is a ring.
    - **Module**: A generalization of a vector space where the scalars come from a ring instead of a field.
