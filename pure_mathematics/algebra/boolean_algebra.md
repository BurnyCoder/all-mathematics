# Boolean Algebra

- **Mathematical Definition**: A Boolean algebra is an algebraic structure that captures the essential properties of logical operations AND, OR, and NOT, as well as set operations intersection, union, and complement. Formally, a Boolean algebra is a complemented distributive lattice. It is a set $A$ equipped with two binary operations $\land$ (meet/AND) and $\lor$ (join/OR), a unary operation $\neg$ (complement/NOT), and two elements $0$ (bottom/false) and $1$ (top/true), such that for all $a, b, c$ in $A$, the following axioms hold: associativity, commutativity, absorption, distributivity, and complementarity.

- **Description**: Boolean algebra is fundamental to computer science, digital logic, and set theory. It provides a way to formalize and reason about logical and set-theoretic operations. It is named after George Boole, who first introduced the system in the mid-19th century.

- **Subfields it's part of**:
    - [Abstract Algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_algebra): It is a specific type of algebraic structure.
    - [Order Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_theory): Boolean algebras are specific kinds of partially ordered sets (lattices).

- **Applications**:
    - **Digital Logic Design**: The design of digital circuits is based directly on Boolean algebra. Logic gates (AND, OR, NOT) perform Boolean operations.
    - **Computer Science**: Used in programming language syntax (boolean data types), algorithm design, and information retrieval.
    - **Set Theory**: The algebra of sets, with union, intersection, and complement, forms a Boolean algebra.

- **Related Concepts**:
    - **[Propositional Logic](../../foundations_of_mathematics/logic/propositional_logic.md)**: The algebra of propositions, with AND, OR, and NOT, is a Boolean algebra.
    - **[Set Theory](../../foundations_of_mathematics/set_theory/set.md)**: The power set of any given set forms a Boolean algebra under the operations of union, intersection, and complement.
    - **[Ring](./ring.md)**: A Boolean ring is a ring in which every element is idempotent, and every Boolean algebra gives rise to a Boolean ring.
