# Group

- **Mathematical Definition**: A group is a set $G$ equipped with a binary operation $\cdot: G \times G \to G$ that satisfies four fundamental axioms:
    1.  **Closure**: For all $a, b \in G$, the result of the operation, $a \cdot b$, is also in $G$.
    2.  **Associativity**: For all $a, b, c \in G$, $(a \cdot b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c)$.
    3.  **Identity Element**: There exists an element $e \in G$ such that for every element $a \in G$, $e \cdot a = a \cdot e = a$.
    4.  **Inverse Element**: For each element $a \in G$, there exists an element $b \in G$, denoted $a^{-1}$, such that $a \cdot b = b \cdot a = e$.

- **Description**: The concept of a group is central to abstract algebra. Groups are used to study symmetry in a formal and rigorous way. The axioms capture the essential properties of transformations like rotations and reflections, as well as systems like the integers under addition. The study of groups is known as group theory.

- **Subfields it's part of**:
    - [Group Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_theory): A group is the fundamental object of study in group theory.
    - [Abstract Algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_algebra): Group theory is one of the central pillars of abstract algebra.
    - [Pure Mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_mathematics): Groups are one of the most fundamental and widely studied structures in pure mathematics.

- **Subfields and concepts it includes**:
    - **Subgroup**: A subset of a group that is itself a group under the same operation.
    - **Group Homomorphism**: A function between two groups that preserves the group operation.
    - **Normal Subgroup**: A subgroup that is invariant under conjugation.
    - **Quotient Group**: A group constructed from a larger group and a normal subgroup.
    - **Group Action**: A way for a group to act on a set, formalizing the idea of symmetry.

- **Applications**:
    - **Physics**: Describing the symmetries of physical laws in particle physics (e.g., the Standard Model), crystallography, and spectroscopy.
    - **Chemistry**: Classifying molecular symmetries and predicting properties of molecules.
    - **Computer Science**: Cryptography (e.g., elliptic curve cryptography), error-correcting codes, and graphics.
    - **Mathematics**: Galois theory (studying roots of polynomials), algebraic topology, and number theory.

- **More Concrete Variants**:
    - **Abelian (Commutative) Group**: A group where the binary operation is commutative ($a \cdot b = b \cdot a$). Example: The integers under addition.
    - **Cyclic Group**: A group that can be generated by a single element.
    - **Finite Group**: A group with a finite number of elements.
    - **Symmetric Group**: The group of all permutations of a set.
    - **Dihedral Group**: The group of symmetries of a regular polygon.
    - **Lie Group**: A group that is also a differentiable manifold, with smooth group operations.

- **More General Variants**:
    - **Monoid**: A set with an associative binary operation and an identity element (drops the inverse axiom).
    - **Semigroup**: A set with an associative binary operation (drops identity and inverse axioms).
    - **Magma (or Groupoid)**: A set with a closed binary operation (drops associativity, identity, and inverse).
    - **[Ring](./ring.md)**: A set with two binary operations (addition and multiplication) that has a group structure for addition.
    - **[Field](./field.md)**: A ring where the non-zero elements form a group under multiplication.

- **Related Concepts**:
    - **[Set](../../foundations_of_mathematics/set_theory/set.md)**: A group is a set with additional structure.
    - **[Category Theory](../../foundations_of_mathematics/category_theory/category.md)**: Groups form a category (**Grp**) where objects are groups and morphisms are group homomorphisms.
    - **Symmetry**: Group theory is the mathematical study of symmetry.
