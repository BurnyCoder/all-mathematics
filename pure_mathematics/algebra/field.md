# Field

- **Mathematical Definition**: A field is a set \\(F\\) together with two binary operations, addition (\\(+\\)) and multiplication (\\(\cdot\\)), such that:
    1.  \\((F, +)\\) is an **abelian group**, with the additive identity element denoted by \\(0\\).
    2.  \\((F \setminus \{0\}, \cdot)\\) is an **abelian group**, with the multiplicative identity element denoted by \\(1\\).
    3.  **Distributivity**: Multiplication distributes over addition. For all \\(a, b, c \in F\\), \\(a \cdot (b+c) = (a \cdot b) + (a \cdot c)\\).

- **Description**: A field is a fundamental algebraic structure that is a commutative ring with unity in which every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse. Fields are the context in which the standard arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) are well-behaved. They are of central importance in algebra and many other areas of mathematics.

- **Subfields it's part of**:
    - [Field Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_theory_(mathematics))
    - [Abstract Algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_algebra)
    - [Pure Mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_mathematics)

- **Subfields and concepts it includes**:
    - **Subfield**: A subset of a field that is itself a field under the same operations.
    - **Field Extension**: A field containing another field as a subfield.
    - **Characteristic**: A number that characterizes the structure of the field's additive group.
    - **Galois Theory**: The study of the relationship between field extensions and group theory.

- **Applications**:
    - **Linear Algebra**: Vector spaces are defined over fields (the scalars).
    - **Number Theory**: The rational numbers, real numbers, and complex numbers are all fields. Algebraic number theory studies extensions of the field of rational numbers.
    - **Cryptography**: Finite fields are extensively used in cryptography, including in the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and elliptic curve cryptography.
    - **Coding Theory**: Used in the construction of error-correcting codes.

- **More Concrete Variants**:
    - **Finite Field (or Galois Field)**: A field with a finite number of elements.
    - **Rational Numbers (\\(\mathbb{Q}\\))**
    - **Real Numbers (\\(\mathbb{R}\\))**
    - **Complex Numbers (\\(\mathbb{C}\\))**
    - **Field of p-adic Numbers (\\(\mathbb{Q}_p\\))**

- **More General Variants**:
    - **Division Ring (or Skew Field)**: A ring in which every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse, but multiplication is not necessarily commutative.
    - **Ring**: The general structure of which fields are a specific type.

- **Related Concepts**:
    - **[Ring](./ring.md)**: A field is a commutative ring where every non-zero element is a unit.
    - **Vector Space**: A set of vectors that can be scaled and added, with the scalars coming from a field.
    - **Polynomial**: Polynomials with coefficients in a field form a ring, and the study of their roots is a central topic (Galois theory).
