# Principle of Least Action

- **Mathematical Definition**: The principle of least action, or more accurately, the **principle of stationary action**, is a variational principle that describes the path taken by a physical system. It states that the path followed by a system between two points in time is the one for which the **action** $S$ is stationary (i.e., its variation is zero). The action is defined as the integral of the [Lagrangian](./lagrangian_mechanics.md) $L$ over time:
$$ S = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} L(q, \dot{q}, t) \,dt $$
  The condition $\delta S = 0$ (meaning the first variation of the action is zero) is what gives rise to the [Euler-Lagrange equations](../analytical_mechanics/lagrangian_mechanics.md), which describe the system's equations of motion.

- **Description**: This principle provides a powerful and elegant way to formulate physical laws. Instead of thinking about forces and accelerations at each moment (the Newtonian view), the principle of least action takes a global perspective: it says that out of all possible paths a system could take, the one it actually does take is an extremum (a minimum, maximum, or saddle point) of the action. This single idea can be used to derive almost all of the fundamental equations of motion in physics.

    - [Fundamental Physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_physics)
    - [Calculus of Variations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_of_variations)

- **Subfields and concepts it includes**:
    - **Action**: The functional that is made stationary.
    - **Lagrangian**: The function that defines the action.
    - **Variational Principle**: A scientific principle that uses the calculus of variations.

- **Applications**:
    - **Classical Mechanics**: Used to derive the equations of motion in both [Lagrangian](./lagrangian_mechanics.md) and [Hamiltonian](./hamiltonian_mechanics.md) mechanics.
    - **Electromagnetism**: The laws of electromagnetism can be derived from an action principle.
    - **General Relativity**: Einstein's field equations can be derived from the Einstein-Hilbert action.
    - **Quantum Mechanics**: Richard Feynman's path integral formulation of quantum mechanics is a direct application of the principle of least action, where a particle explores all possible paths between two points, and the phase of its wave function is determined by the action of each path.

- **More Concrete Variants**:
    - **Fermat's Principle**: In optics, the path taken by a ray of light between two points is the path that can be traversed in the least time. This is an early example of an action principle.

- **More General Variants**:
    - **Path Integral Formulation**: The generalization of the action principle to quantum mechanics.

- **Related Concepts**:
    - **[Lagrangian Mechanics](./lagrangian_mechanics.md)**: Directly derived from the principle of stationary action.
    - **[Euler-Lagrange Equation](./lagrangian_mechanics.md)**: The mathematical result of applying the principle of stationary action.
    - **Symmetry and Conservation Laws (Noether's Theorem)**: Noether's theorem states that for every continuous symmetry of the action of a physical system, there is a corresponding conserved quantity. This is a profound consequence of the action principle.
