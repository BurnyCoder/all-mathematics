# Einstein's Field Equations

- **Mathematical Definition**: Einstein's field equations (EFE) are a set of 10 coupled non-linear partial differential equations in Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity. They describe the fundamental interaction of gravitation as a result of spacetime being curved by matter and energy. The equations are written in tensor calculus as:
  \\( R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2} R g_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4} T_{\mu\nu} \\)
  where:
    - \\(R_{\mu\nu}\\) is the **Ricci curvature tensor**.
    - \\(R\\) is the **scalar curvature**.
    - \\(g_{\mu\nu}\\) is the **metric tensor**, which defines the geometry of spacetime.
    - \\(\Lambda\\) is the **cosmological constant**.
    - \\(G\\) is Newton's gravitational constant.
    - \\(c\\) is the speed of light in vacuum.
    - \\(T_{\mu\nu}\\) is the **stress-energy tensor**, which represents the density and flux of energy and momentum of matter.
  The left side of the equation represents the curvature of spacetime (geometry), while the right side represents the matter and energy content.

- **Description**: The essence of the EFE is often summarized as: "spacetime tells matter how to move; matter tells spacetime how to curve." They are the core of general relativity, replacing Newton's law of universal gravitation. The equations' solutions are metric tensors which describe the geometry of a spacetime, from which the paths of objects (geodesics) can be calculated.

- **Subfields and concepts it includes**:
    - **Tensor Calculus**: The mathematical language of the EFE.
    - **Metric Tensor (\\(g_{\mu\nu}\\))**: Defines distances and angles on a manifold.
    - **Curvature (Ricci and Scalar)**: Describes how the geometry of spacetime deviates from being flat.
    - **Stress-Energy Tensor (\\(T_{\mu\nu}\\))**: Describes the distribution of matter and energy.
    - **Geodesic**: The generalization of a "straight line" to curved spacetime; the path that free-falling particles follow.

- **Applications**:
    - **Cosmology**: Describing the evolution of the universe (the Big Bang, the expansion of the universe).
    - **Astrophysics**: Predicting the existence of black holes, gravitational lensing, and gravitational waves.
    - **GPS Technology**: The equations are necessary to account for the relativistic effects on the timing of GPS satellites to ensure accurate positioning.

- **More Concrete Variants**:
    - **Vacuum Field Equations**: The case where \\(T_{\mu\nu}=0\\), describing regions of spacetime devoid of matter.
    - **Schwarzschild Solution**: A solution to the vacuum field equations that describes the spacetime around a spherical mass, predicting the existence of black holes.
    - **Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker (FLRW) metric**: A solution that describes a homogeneous, isotropic, expanding or contracting universe.

- **More General Variants**:
    - **Einstein-Cartan theory**: An extension of general relativity to include spacetime torsion.
    - **String Theory and Quantum Gravity**: Attempts to unify general relativity with quantum mechanics, where the EFE are expected to emerge as a low-energy approximation.

- **Related Concepts**:
    - **[Manifold](../../pure_mathematics/geometry/manifold.md)**: Spacetime is modeled as a 4-dimensional pseudo-Riemannian manifold.
    - **[Partial Differential Equation](../../applied_mathematics/differential_equations/pde.md)**: The EFE are a complex system of non-linear PDEs.
    - **[Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation](../classical_mechanics/newtons_law_of_gravitation.md)**: Can be recovered from the EFE in the weak-field, low-speed limit.
