# Wave Equation

- **Mathematical Definition**: The wave equation is a second-order linear partial differential equation that describes the propagation of a variety of waves, such as sound waves, light waves, and water waves. For a scalar function $u(x_1, ..., x_n, t)$, the wave equation is:
$$ \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \nabla^2 u $$
  or
$$ \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \left( \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x_1^2} + \dots + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x_n^2} \right) $$
  where $c$ is a constant representing the propagation speed of the wave, and $\nabla^2$ is the [Laplace operator](../../pure_mathematics/analysis/laplace_operator.md).

- **Description**: The wave equation is a hyperbolic partial differential equation and is a fundamental equation in classical physics. It models phenomena where disturbances travel at a finite speed. Solutions to the wave equation describe the amplitude of the wave at a given point in space and time. Unlike the heat equation, which models dissipative processes, the wave equation models conservative processes where energy is typically conserved.
