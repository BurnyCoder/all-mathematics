# Second Law of Thermodynamics

- **Mathematical Definition**: The second law of thermodynamics can be expressed in several ways. For an isolated system, the change in entropy ($\Delta S$) is always greater than or equal to zero.
$$ \Delta S \ge 0 $$
  For a closed system undergoing a process, the Clausius inequality holds:
$$ \oint \frac{\delta Q}{T} \le 0 $$
  where the equality holds for a reversible process.

- **Description**: The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that the total entropy of an isolated system can only increase over time. It can remain constant in ideal cases where the system is in a steady state (equilibrium) or undergoing a reversible process. This law establishes the concept of irreversibility in natural processes and defines the "arrow of time."

- **Subfields it's part of**:
    - [Thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamics): One of the four fundamental laws.
    - [Statistical Mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_mechanics): Provides a microscopic explanation for the second law via concepts like entropy.
    - [Physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics): A fundamental law with wide-ranging implications.
    - [Chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry): Determines the spontaneity of chemical reactions.
    - [Information Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory): Deeply connected to the concept of information entropy.
    - [Calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus): The Clausius inequality is expressed as a cyclic integral.
    - [Probability Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_theory): The statistical mechanics formulation of the second law interprets the increase in entropy as a system moving towards a more probable, higher-entropy state.

- **Subfields and concepts it includes**:
    - **Entropy ($S$)**: A measure of disorder, randomness, or energy dispersal.
    - **Irreversibility**: The idea that natural processes have a preferred direction.
    - **Arrow of Time**: The observation that the past is different from the future.
    - **Heat Engine**: A device that converts thermal energy into mechanical work.
    - **Carnot Cycle**: The most efficient possible heat engine cycle.

- **Applications**:
    - **Engine Efficiency**: Sets the theoretical limit on the efficiency of heat engines.
    - **Chemical Reactions**: Predicts whether a reaction will occur spontaneously.
    - **Cosmology**: Used to understand the thermodynamic arrow of time in the universe.
    - **Information Theory**: Landauer's principle, which sets a lower bound on energy consumption for computation, is based on the second law.

- **More Concrete Variants/Formulations**:
    - **Clausius Statement**: Heat cannot spontaneously flow from a colder body to a hotter body.
    - **Kelvin-Planck Statement**: It is impossible for any device that operates on a cycle to receive heat from a single reservoir and produce a net amount of work.
    - **Carnot's Theorem**: No engine operating between two heat reservoirs can be more efficient than a Carnot engine operating between the same two reservoirs.

- **More General Variants**:
    - **Fluctuation Theorems**: Generalize the second law to microscopic systems and systems far from equilibrium.
    - **Information-Theoretic Formulations**: Relate thermodynamic entropy to information entropy, providing a more general perspective.
