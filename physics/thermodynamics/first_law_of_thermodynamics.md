# First Law of Thermodynamics

- **Mathematical Definition**: The First Law of Thermodynamics is a statement of the conservation of energy. For a closed system, the change in internal energy ($\Delta U$) is equal to the heat ($Q$) added to the system minus the work ($W$) done by the system.
$$ \Delta U = Q - W $$
  This can also be written in differential form:
$$ dU = \delta Q - \delta W $$
  where $dU$ is an exact differential, but $\delta Q$ and $\delta W$ are inexact differentials, as they depend on the path of the process.

- **Description**: The First Law states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred or changed from one form to another. It is one of the most fundamental principles in physics and chemistry.

- **Subfields it's part of**:
    - [Thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamics): It is one of the four fundamental laws of thermodynamics.
    - [Physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics): It is a specific statement of the general principle of conservation of energy.
    - [Chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry): It is crucial for understanding the energy changes that occur in chemical reactions (thermochemistry).
    - [Engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering): Essential for the analysis and design of engines, power plants, and refrigeration systems.
    - [Calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus): The law is expressed using differentials. A key mathematical point is the distinction between the exact differential $dU$ (since internal energy is a state function) and the inexact differentials $\delta Q$ and $\delta W$ (since heat and work are path-dependent).
    - [Differential Equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation): The law is a differential equation that relates the changes in energy, heat, and work.

- **Subfields and concepts it includes**:
    - **Internal Energy ($U$)**: The total energy contained within a system, excluding the kinetic and potential energy of the system as a whole.
    - **Heat ($Q$)**: The energy transferred between systems due to a temperature difference.
    - **Work ($W$)**: The energy transferred when a force acts on an object, causing a displacement.
    - **Conservation of Energy**: The principle that the total energy of an isolated system remains constant.

- **Applications**:
    - **Engines**: The law governs the conversion of heat into mechanical work in heat engines.
    - **Refrigerators and Heat Pumps**: It describes the transfer of heat from a colder to a hotter body.
    - **Chemical Reactions**: Used to calculate the heat absorbed or released in a chemical reaction (enthalpy change).
    - **Biological Systems**: Explains the energy balance in living organisms.

- **More Concrete Variants**:
    - **Adiabatic Process**: A process with no heat transfer ($\delta Q = 0$), so $dU = -\delta W$.
    - **Isochoric Process**: A constant-volume process ($\delta W = 0$), so $dU = \delta Q$.
    - **Isobaric Process**: A constant-pressure process, where work is $W = P\Delta V$.
    - **Isothermal Process**: A constant-temperature process. For an ideal gas, $\Delta U = 0$, so $Q = W$.

- **More General Variants**:
    - **Principle of Conservation of Energy**: The first law is a formulation of this universal principle.
    - **Noether's Theorem**: In theoretical physics, the conservation of energy is a consequence of the time-invariance of physical laws.
    - **First Law for Open Systems**: Includes terms for the energy carried by mass entering or leaving the system.

- **Related Concepts**:
    - **Zeroth, Second, and Third Laws of Thermodynamics**: Together, they form the axiomatic basis of thermodynamics.
    - **Enthalpy**: A thermodynamic potential, defined as $H = U + PV$.
    - **[Hamiltonian Mechanics](../analytical_mechanics/hamiltonian_mechanics.md)**: In classical mechanics, for a closed system, the Hamiltonian represents the total energy, which is conserved.
