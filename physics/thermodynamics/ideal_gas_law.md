# Ideal Gas Law

- **Mathematical Definition**: The ideal gas law is the equation of state of a hypothetical ideal gas. It is given by:
$$ PV = nRT $$
  where:
    - $P$ is the pressure of the gas.
    - $V$ is the volume of the gas.
    - $n$ is the amount of substance of the gas (in moles).
    - $R$ is the ideal, or universal, gas constant.
    - $T$ is the thermodynamic temperature of the gas.

- **Description**: The ideal gas law is a good approximation of the behavior of many gases under many conditions, although it has several limitations. It is most accurate for monatomic gases at high temperatures and low pressures. It does not account for the volume of the gas molecules or the intermolecular forces.

- **Subfields it's part of**:
    - [Thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamics): It is a fundamental equation of state in thermodynamics.
    - [Statistical Mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_mechanics): It can be derived from the principles of statistical mechanics.
    - [Chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry): Widely used in stoichiometry and to describe the behavior of gases in chemical reactions.
    - [Physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics): A core concept in the study of gases.
    - [Algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra): The law is fundamentally an algebraic equation relating several variables.
    - [Calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus): The relationships between the variables can be explored using calculus, for example, by examining partial derivatives to understand how one variable changes with respect to another while others are held constant.

- **Subfields and concepts it includes**:
    - **Pressure**: Force per unit area.
    - **Volume**: The space occupied by the gas.
    - **Temperature**: A measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles.
    - **Mole**: A unit for the amount of substance.

- **Applications**:
    - **Chemistry**: Calculating volumes, pressures, temperatures, or amounts of gas in chemical reactions.
    - **Engineering**: Designing and analyzing systems involving gases, such as engines and turbines.
    - **Meteorology**: Understanding and predicting weather patterns, which involve large bodies of gas (the atmosphere).

- **More Concrete Variants**:
    - **Boyle's Law**: At constant temperature, the pressure of a gas is inversely proportional to its volume ($PV = k$).
    - **Charles's Law**: At constant pressure, the volume of a gas is directly proportional to its temperature ($V/T = k$).
    - **Gay-Lussac's Law**: At constant volume, the pressure of a gas is directly proportional to its temperature ($P/T = k$).
    - **Avogadro's Law**: Equal volumes of all gases, at the same temperature and pressure, have the same number of molecules ($V/n = k$).

- **More General Variants**:
    - **Van der Waals equation**: An equation of state that extends the ideal gas law to account for the finite volume of gas molecules and the attractive forces between them.
    - **Virial Expansion**: A model of real gas behavior as a power series in the density.

- **Related Concepts**:
    - **Kinetic Theory of Gases**: The microscopic model of a gas from which the ideal gas law can be derived.
    - **[First Law of Thermodynamics](./first_law_of_thermodynamics.md)**: The internal energy of an ideal gas depends only on its temperature.
