# The Standard Model of Particle Physics

- **Mathematical Definition**: The Standard Model is a quantum field theory whose dynamics are encoded in a **Lagrangian density** $\mathcal{L}$. This Lagrangian is constructed to be invariant under the local gauge transformations of the symmetry group **$SU(3)_C \times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$**. The theory describes:
    - **Fermions** (matter particles): Quarks and leptons, which are represented by spinor fields.
    - **Gauge Bosons** (force carriers): Gluons, W and Z bosons, and photons, which are represented by vector fields that arise from the gauge symmetry.
    - **The Higgs Boson**: A scalar field whose self-interaction and coupling to other particles (via the Higgs mechanism) gives them mass.
The full Standard Model Lagrangian is a complex expression that contains terms for the kinetic energy of all these fields and their interactions.

- **Description**: The Standard Model of Particle Physics is the theory that describes three of the four known fundamental forces (electromagnetic, weak, and strong interactions) and classifies all known elementary particles. It is the most rigorously tested and successful scientific theory in history, providing precise predictions for a vast range of particle physics experiments. However, it is known to be incomplete as it does not include gravity or account for phenomena like dark matter and dark energy.

- **Subfields and concepts it includes**:
    - **Elementary Particles**: The fundamental constituents of matter (quarks, leptons) and force (gauge bosons).
    - **Fundamental Forces**: The strong, weak, and electromagnetic forces.
    - **Gauge Theory**: The mathematical framework describing the forces.
    - **Higgs Mechanism**: The process by which elementary particles acquire mass.
    - **Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)**: The theory of the strong interaction (governed by $SU(3)_C$).
    - **Electroweak Theory**: The unified theory of the electromagnetic and weak interactions (governed by $SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$).

- **Applications**:
    - **Particle Accelerators**: The theory is used to predict and interpret the results of experiments at facilities like the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).
    - **Cosmology**: Describes the state of the universe in its earliest moments after the Big Bang.

- **More Concrete Variants**:
    - This is a specific model, so it has no more concrete variants.

- **More General Variants**:
    - **Grand Unified Theories (GUTs)**: Theories that attempt to unify the strong, weak, and electromagnetic forces into a single force at high energies.
    - **Supersymmetry (SUSY)**: A proposed extension of the Standard Model that posits a symmetry between fermions and bosons.
    - **String Theory**: A theoretical framework that attempts to unify all fundamental forces, including gravity, by modeling particles as one-dimensional "strings".

- **Related Concepts**:
    - **[Lagrangian Mechanics](../analytical_mechanics/lagrangian_mechanics.md)**: The entire theory is formulated in terms of a Lagrangian.
    - **[Group Theory](../../pure_mathematics/algebra/group.md)**: The symmetries of the Standard Model are described by Lie groups.
    - **[Special Relativity](../special_relativity/special_relativity.md)**: The theory is a relativistic quantum field theory, consistent with special relativity.
    - **[General Relativity](../general_relativity/einstein_field_equations.md)**: The Standard Model does not include gravity, and unifying it with general relativity is a major unsolved problem in physics.
