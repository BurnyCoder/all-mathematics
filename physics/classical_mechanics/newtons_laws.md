# Newton's Laws of Motion

- **Mathematical Definition**: Newton's Laws of Motion are three physical laws that, together, laid the foundation for classical mechanics. They are typically stated as follows:
    1.  **First Law (Law of Inertia)**: An object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force. Mathematically, if the net force $\mathbf{F}$ on an object is zero, then its velocity $\mathbf{v}$ is constant: $ \mathbf{F} = 0 \iff \frac{d\mathbf{v}}{dt} = 0 $.
    2.  **Second Law**: The acceleration $\mathbf{a}$ of an object is directly proportional to the net force $\mathbf{F}$ acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass $m$. This is famously expressed as a differential equation:
        $$ \mathbf{F} = m\mathbf{a} = m\frac{d\mathbf{v}}{dt} = m\frac{d^2\mathbf{x}}{dt^2} $$
        where $\mathbf{x}$ is the position of the object.
    3.  **Third Law**: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. If object A exerts a force $\mathbf{F}_{AB}$ on object B, then object B simultaneously exerts a force $\mathbf{F}_{BA}$ on object A, and $\mathbf{F}_{AB} = -\mathbf{F}_{BA}$.

- **Description**: These three laws describe the relationship between a body and the forces acting upon it, and its motion in response to those forces. They have been fundamental to the development of technology since their inception and are sufficient for describing the motion of macroscopic objects at speeds much slower than the speed of light.

- **Subfields it's part of**:
    - [Classical Mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics)
    - [Physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics)

- **Subfields and concepts it includes**:
    - **Force**: An influence that can change the motion of an object.
    - **Mass**: A measure of an object's inertia.
    - **Momentum**: The product of an object's mass and velocity ($\mathbf{p} = m\mathbf{v}$). The second law can be stated more generally as $\mathbf{F} = \frac{d\mathbf{p}}{dt}$.
    - **Inertial Frame of Reference**: A frame of reference in which Newton's First Law is valid.

- **Applications**:
    - **Engineering**: Designing structures, vehicles (cars, planes, rockets), and machines of all types.
    - **Astronomy**: Calculating the orbits of planets, moons, and satellites (celestial mechanics).
    - **Everyday life**: Understanding the motion of everyday objects.

- **More Concrete Variants**:
    - **Statics**: The study of forces on objects that are not accelerating.
    - **Dynamics**: The study of forces on objects that are accelerating.
    - **Kinematics**: The description of motion without considering its causes.

- **More General Variants**:
    - **Lagrangian Mechanics**: A reformulation of classical mechanics that is based on the principle of stationary action and uses generalized coordinates.
    - **Hamiltonian Mechanics**: Another reformulation of classical mechanics that is based on Lagrangian mechanics and is fundamental to the formulation of quantum mechanics.
    - **Special Relativity**: Extends mechanics to speeds approaching the speed of light.
    - **General Relativity**: A theory of gravitation that supplants Newton's law of universal gravitation.
    - **Quantum Mechanics**: Describes the motion and interaction of subatomic particles.

- **Related Concepts**:
    - **[Differential Equation](../../applied_mathematics/differential_equations/differential_equation.md)**: Newton's second law is a second-order ordinary differential equation.
    - **[Vector](../../pure_mathematics/algebra/vector_space.md)**: Force, velocity, and acceleration are vector quantities.
    - **Calculus**: The laws are expressed using derivatives, a central concept in calculus.
